# XRayGUI
A small and nimble GUI for [XRay](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core) - all in one rpm/deb package: launch, find `VMESS` configurations on the network, copy to the buffer, paste into `XRayGUI` (`Paste` button) and click `Start`. If the green indicator lights up and the logs run, the connection is established. In the browser, set the SOCKS5 - `127.0.0.1`:`1089` proxy and redirect DNS via proxy (check the box there).
