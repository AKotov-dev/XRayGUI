# XRayGUI
A small and nimble GUI + [XRay-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core) - all in one rpm/deb package: launch, find `VMESS/VLESS (WS, WS+TLS)`, `SS (Shadowsocks without obfs)` or `Trojan (TLS/WebSocket)` configurations on the network, copy to the buffer, paste into `XRayGUI` (`Paste` button) and click `Start`. If the green indicator lights up and the logs run, the connection is established. In the browser, set the SOCKS5 - `127.0.0.1`:`1089` proxy and redirect DNS via proxy (check the box there). The list of configurations can be saved to a file and downloaded from a file (PopUp Menu). You can check your new location here: https://whoer.net
